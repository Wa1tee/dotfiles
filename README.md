Here is a collection of configuration files for some software I prefer to use.

## Neovim
This is my main code editor. In addition I use VimWiki plugin as a personal knowledge management system and diary

## Vim
I used to use Vim as my main editor until probably November 2022 when I moved over to Neovim. I still keep a simplified Vim configuration I can drop in to get a decent and comfortable environment anywhere

## Emacs
This is very much work in progress and I am still not convinced with Emacs. My configuration is probably terrible if you have any prior knowledge of Emacs.

## Bash
## Git
